**Storyteller**
-create a new project, call it "UserStory"
-include string and iostream
	#include <string>
	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;

-before we plan the code, we need to plan a story
	-lower the laptop lids, give them 5 min to write a 7-8 line story
	-listen to the stories

-come back to the computer
	-output those lines using cout
	-look back those lines
		-what is the subject of your story
		-adjectives used?
		-setting?
	-create a variable for each of these
	string subject = "";
	string adjective = "";
	string setting = "";
	
	-now ask for user input for a subject, adjective, and setting!
	cout << "Welcome to story builder!" << endl;
	cout << "Enter a subject: " << endl;
	cin >> subject;
	cout << "Enter an adjective: " << endl;
	cin >> adjective;
	cout << "Enter a setting: " << endl;
	cin >> setting;

	//then print out the story again
	//kinda make like a madlibs
