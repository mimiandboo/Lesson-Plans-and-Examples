**Control Flow continued
-i didn't go over jump statements or switch statements
	but if you want to look over those, it'll be in gamePlan under control flow
-opening and closing files
-in the header space, type
	#include <fstream>

	fstream fileStream;
	//this is an fstream variable which handles file input and output 	

	fileStream.open("textFile.txt", ios::out);
	//output mode to write into the files (yes confusing)
	//opens the file textFile.txt, or creates it if 
	if(!fileStream.is_open()){
		cout << "Error" << endl;
		return 0;	
	}

	fileStream << "Test writing into this file\n";
	//use an insertion operator when writing into files
	fileStream << "Another line of nonsense\n";
	fileStream << "Last line\n";

	fileStream.close();
	
	return 0;

	//end of main()

-next, lets try reading user input into a file
	fstream file;
	string line;
	
	file.open("newText.txt");
	
	if(!file.is_open()){
		cout << "Error" << endl;
		return 0;
	}	

	cout << "Please enter one sentence: " << endl;
	cin >> line;
	file << line;

	return 0;
	//end of main()	

-now that we have a textFile.txt, lets read what was in it
	(should be what we put into it)

	fstream outputFile;
	string line;
	
	outputFile.open("textFile.txt", ios::in);
	//input mode to read out of it (opposite day)
	if(!outputFile.is_open()){
		cout << "Error" << endl;
		return 0;
	}
	
	//prints out every line in the file
	while(getline(outputFile, line)){
		cout << line << endl;
	}

	outputFile.close();

	return 0;
	//end of main

-end of files lesson
-next we will learn about random generator
	-sometimes we want a random number, like maybe we want to roll a die
	-lets make a random die generator

	#include <iostream>

	using namespace std;

	int main(){
				
	}
