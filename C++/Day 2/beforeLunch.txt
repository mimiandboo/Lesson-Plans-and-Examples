-arithmetic operators 
	() : parentheses
	++/-- : increment or decrement by 1
	+/-///* : plus, minus, divide, multiply
	= : assignment
	+=/-=/*=//=/%=
	% : modulus
		-remainder essentially
		3 % 2 = ? (1)
		29 % 3 = ? (2)
-try this:
	int level = 1;
	int points = 20;

	cout << "Level " << level << endl;
	cout << "Points " << points << endl;
	
	points += 5;
	level++;
	
	cout << "New level " << level << endl;
	cout << "New points " << points << endl;
	
	double divide = points / level;	
	double mod = points % level;
	
	cout << "Points / level " << divide << endl;
	cout << "Points % level " << mod << endl;
	//try new things, check everything out
	//will debug if help is needed

-if then statements
	-conditional statements
	-if it is raining outside, then use an umbrella
	-if the instructor is talking, then you are quiet
	-to practice, lets create a new C++ program 

	#include <iostream>
	#include <string>
	
	using namespace std;

	//pretend a main function is here
	int testNum = 5;

	if(testNum % 2 == 0){
		cout << "The number is even!" << endl;
	}
	else{
		cout << "The number is odd!" << endl;
	}

	//now try improving this program so it takes in user input
	//and determines if the number is even or odd
********************************************************************
	int testNum;
	
	cout << "Enter a number: " << endl;
	cin >> testNum;
	
	if(testNum % 2 == 0){
		cout << "The number is even!" << endl;
	}
	else{
		cout << "The number is odd!" << endl;
	}

//we could also add else if

	if()
	else if()
	else if()
	else

-difference between = and ==?
	-one's an assignment, one is a conditional
	-test = 20, means that the variable test has been assigned the number 20
	-if(test == 20), this asks if test is equal to 20, will return true or false

-for if statements
	-you can use ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
	-! means not; != does not equal

-write a program that'll read a user input of a grade (int)
	and will display the letter grade corresponding to it
	ex: if i enter 90, it will display an A
	if i enter anything under 60, display an F

-next, try writing the same kind of program, but will read a char instead
	so i enter an A, and it'll display a message like "Well done! You got an A!"
	or I enter F, and it'll display "You failed. Do better work next time"
	or something

-while loops
	-will repeat a code a number of times *while* a condition is true
	int num = 0;
	while(num < 3){
		num++;	//increments the variable num by 1 through each loop
		cout << "Number = " << num << endl;
	}
	
	cout << "Final number is " << num << endl;

-make a program that'll continue asking the user to guess a number (your pick) from 1 - 20
	make sure that if they get it wrong then you ask again, and you continue this until they get it right
	
	int answer = 18;
	int guess;

	cout << "Guess a number from 1 - 20!" << endl;
	cin >> guess;

	while(guess != answer){
		cout << "Guess again!" << endl;
		cin >> guess;
	}

-for loop: runs a block of code a set number of times
	not based on a conditional

	for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	//for initializes the for loop
	//int i = 0; initializes a variable "i" in the parentheses
	//i < 10; means that this will loop while i is less than 10
	//i++ increments i every loop

-i will create a for loop that'll just print out Hello World 5 times
	for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
		cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
	}

-next is a longer for loop about how much money i have (given that i don't earn any, and just continue to spend $5)
	int total = 100;	//i have 100 dollars
	
	cout << "I have " << total << " dollars" << endl;

	for(int i = total; i > 0; i++){
		total -= 5;
		cout << "Now I have " << total << endl;
	}

	cout << "I now have " << total << " dollars" << endl;
