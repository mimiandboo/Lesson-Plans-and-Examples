Introduction:
-set expectations:
	-be kind to fellow peers
	-stay on task
	-listen to my instructions
	-be silent while I'm instructing
	-stay off your phone, and other

**Getting started:
-create an account on gameplan
-open IntelliJ
-follow gameplan's steps **very** carefully
-once you are done, show me
-if you have any questions, raise your hand quietly
-once minecraft has opened, select single player
	-create new world
	-enter name for world
	-select creative mode
	-click create new world
-press e in inventory
-click miscellaneous tab
-scroll to the bottom to access modded items
	-these are the types of things you'll be making!
-take 5 min to test out
-Structure gel
-go back to intelliJ projects
	-expand forgeresourcepacket (little arrow button)
	-src/main/java > comtech.idtech > item
	-open ItemStructureGel.java
-try changing the name
-save
-run your mod
-changing tabs **
	-you can change the tab in which the item will appear
	-tab = CreativeTabs.BREWING
	-save
	-run
-you can change the texture of the item
	-expand src/main/resources > assets > examplemod > textures > items
	-it has to end be a png file

**after lunch
-y'all were asking about items that actually does things
	-we don't want just a structure gel that does nothing (that's boring)
-src/main/java/com.idtech/item
	-right click on item and select new java class 
	-call it ItemSqueakyBall
	-click ok
-should open up a new java class file
-next to public class ItemSqueakyBall
	-type extends QuickItem
	-right after ItemSqueakyBall, add a curly bracket and press enter
		name = "Squeaky Ball";
		tab = CreativeTab.MISC;
		texture = "squeakyball";
	-save and run
	-right now this item doesn't do anything BUT listen closely, next instructions will tell you
-when you right click on something in minecraft it calls the rightclick method (sends instruction to the computer that you right clicked
	-so outside that first curly bracket inside, press enter enter
	-type 
		public void onRightClick(){
			//code goes here
			displayMessage("Squeak squeak!");
		}
	-save and run
	-when holding this item right click and it should say "Squeak squeak!"
-now lets try to actually make sound
	-call the playSound function
		playSound(SoundEvents.ENTITY_BAT_AMBIENT);
	-save and run!
	-now try doing different sounds
**Building block
-ForgeResourcePacket/src/main/java/com.idtech/block > blockbuilding
	-try changing the name Castle Wall
	-change the texture to castewall (it can be viewed under src/main/resources/assets/examplemods/textures/blocks)
	-save and test
-we are learning how to make your own building blocks for the next exercise
-create a new java class in blocks under src/main/java/com.idtech/block
	by right clicking and hovering over new and create a new java class
-call it BreadBlock
-extends QuickBlock
-add name and texture
	-use the breadblock texture
	-in the same space between curly brackets, type 
		itemDropped = Items.BREAD;
	-save and test
**teleport rod
-lets go back to items
-create a new java class in items
	-extends QuickItem
	-import net.minecraft.util.math.BlockPos
	-src/main/java/com.idtech/item
	-name and texture (choose your favorite texture from src/main/resources/assets/examplemods/textures/blocks)
-outside of the first curly bracket, type 
	public void onRightClick(){
		BlockPos block = findBlockAtCursor(100);
		moveToBlock(block);
	}
-save and run
