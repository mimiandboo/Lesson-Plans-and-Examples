*Lightning Hammer:
-create an item 
	-src/main/java/com.idtech/item 
	-create new java class
	-name it thorHammer
-extends QuickItem next to the name of the Class
-add {}
-press enter
-name and texture (find the hammer texture)
	-src/main/resources/assets/examplemods/texture
-after the first }
	public void onRightClick(){
		BlockPos block = findBlockAtCursor(20);
		createLightningBolt(block);
	}
-save and run
	(should only create a lightning strike)
-now adding on
	float explosionSize = 20;
	boolean destroyBlocks = true;
	createExplosion(block, explosionSize, destroyBlocks);
-save and run
-now some of y'all were asking me what about healing items?
-lets make that
**mug:
-create a new java class in item
	-src/main/java/com.idtech/item
	-name it ItemMug
	-extends QuickItem
	-import 
-create a name and texture
	-use the mug, we'll be making it seem like drinking from this mug heals you
-outside the first }
	public void onRightClick(){
		player.heal(10);
		//try negative number
	}
-save and run
-we can also spawn particles
	spawnParticles(player, EnumParticleTypes.RED_STONE);
-save and run
**Creeping mold
-sometimes we want a block to perform an action all on its own
	-the bread block needs to be hit to perform an action (drop bread) remember?
-create a new block java class
	-src/main/java/com.idtech/block
	-name it CreepingMold
	-extends QuickBlock
	-import net.minecraft.util.math.BlockPos
	-{}
	-name and texture
-next step is to set it so that it's running at random intervals of time
	setTickRandomly(true);
-after }
	public void onRandomTick(){
		BlockPos neighbor = findNeighborBlock();
		cloneAt(neighbor);
	}
-save and run

**Rubber Block
-make a new block to jump! make it rubbery
-new java class in block 
	-src/main/java/com.idtech/block
	-name it RubberBlock
	-extends QuickBlock
	-add {}
	-name and texture
-after }
	public void onEntityWalk(){
		entity.motionY += 1;
	}
-save and run

**Hot coals
-here's some code to increase hardness in a block so that it's not easy to destroy in one hit 
-create new java class in block
	-src/main/java/com.idtech/block
	-name it HotCoals
	-extends QuickBlock
	-add {}
	-name and texture
	-add itemDropped = Items.COAL;	//when mined it will drop coals
	-setHarvestLevel(PICKAXE, WOOD);
	-setHardness(10);
	-setLightLevel(0.5f);

-new Java project
	-this is where I hear your ideas!
	-we'll write these down
-file > new > project
	-hit next twice
	-name it Intro to Java
	-finish

-Print statements
	-create a new java class in src
	-name it printPractice
	-inside {}
		public void main(String[] args){
			System.out.println("Hello World!");
		}	
	-to run the code, right click on the file on the left side and click run (the one without Coverage)
	or Ctrl Shift f10
	-now try adding more print functions!
	System.out.println("More print! Print more sentences");
	
-Variables
	-string, char, boolean, int, float, double
	-string to store text
	-char to store characters
	-boolean to store integers
	-double to store decimals
	-float to store more integers (bigger numbers)
-creating a variable in code
	-must first initialize it
	String name = "Cookie";
	int age = 100;
	System.out.println("Hello! My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old!");
-save and run
-initializing doubles
